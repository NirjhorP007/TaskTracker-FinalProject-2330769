# Task Tracker – Diploma Project  
**Mobile Application Programming**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Task Tracker** is a React-based web application developed as part of my **Diploma Project in Mobile Application Programming**. The application is designed to help users manage daily tasks by allowing them to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks when they are no longer required.

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate a clear understanding of fundamental **React concepts** and **component-based application development**. The project emphasizes functionality, clarity, and correctness rather than advanced visual design.

Key concepts demonstrated in this project include:

- Functional components  
- State management using `useState`  
- Props and event handling  
- List rendering using `map()`  
- Conditional rendering and styling  

The application also provides real-time task statistics to support effective task tracking.

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
- Install **Node.js** from: https://nodejs.org  

### Installation and Execution

1. Open the project folder using a code editor such as **Visual Studio Code**
2. Install the required dependencies:

Open the generated local URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173/) in a web browser

📝 Application Usage
The Task Tracker application supports the following user actions:

Add Tasks: Enter a task name and add it to the task list

Mark Tasks as Completed: Toggle task completion status with visual distinction

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list when no longer needed

View Task Statistics: View the total number of tasks and completed tasks updated in real time
